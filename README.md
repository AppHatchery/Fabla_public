### Architecture
The application uses the Clean Architecture pattern, with the following layers:

#### Core
This layer contains the most fundamental elements of the application. It includes common utilities, interfaces, and abstractions that are not specific to any particular feature.

##### Error
Handling and categorizing errors or exceptions.

##### Network
Defining networking-related abstractions.

##### Use Cases
Interfaces for use cases that the domain layer can implement.

#### Data Layer
This is the layer responsible for handling data sources, external services, and data models specific to a screen.

##### Data Models
This layer contains the data models for a screen.

#### Domain Layer
This layer contains the core business logic and entities of the application.

##### Entities
Objects that represent business entities and hold essential data and behavior.

##### Repositories
Interfaces that define the contract for interacting with data sources in the data layer.

#### Presentation Layer
This is the user interface layer responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions.

##### Cubit/Bloc
The Cubit/Bloc layer is responsible for handling state management and business logic for a screen.

##### Pages
The Pages layer is responsible for rendering the UI for a screen.

##### Widgets
The Widgets layer is responsible for rendering the UI components for a screen.


#### Services
This layer contains the services that the application uses. for example, the notification service.
